# lora_messenger
This project demonstrates a LoRa-based wireless messaging system using two ESP32 boards and SX1276 LoRa modules , with the sender controlled via a web interface and the receiver displaying messages on an OLED screen, buzzing and blinking an LED on reception. Both sender and receiver use FreeRTOS tasks for concurrent operation.
